Using tsconfig.json

1.  By invoking tsc with no input files, 
    the compiler searches for the tsconfig.json 
    file starting in the current directory and 
    continuing up the parent directory chain.

2.  By invoking tsc with no input files and 
    a --project (or just -p) command line option 
    that specifies the path of a directory containing 
    a tsconfig.json file.



Read tsconfig.json:
1. In same directory                            : tsc -p ./
2. In other directory                           : tsc -p path_to_config_json_file
3.  Starting in the current directory and       : tsc
    continuing up the parent directory chain
